## Description:

Most universities and colleges across the country follow the conventional method of marking attendance for each student manually. This is done either by signing one’s name on a register or a sheet of paper that is passed around by the professor at the end of the lecture, or the name of each student is called out loud by the professor, and the attendance is marked manually. Both these methods are not only tedious and time-consuming, especially in courses and lectures with a large number of students, but they are also susceptible to malpractices such as fake/false attendance or “ proxy ”. To overcome these issues, we have designed a smart attendance management system that makes the entire process seamless for the student as well as the professor. The student will be required to register with their name, email id, and phone number. Before every lecture, the respective professor will be able to generate a unique QR code which the students need to scan with their smartphones in order to mark their attendance for that particular lecture. The QR code is unique to that particular class and cannot be reused again. Before scanning the QR code, each student is authenticated via biometric authentication   ( fingerprint scanning), which eliminates any possibility of fake attendance. The professor can also easily  view  and keep track of all the previous attendance record for any student on the portal. It takes less than 30 seconds for scanning the QR code, thus making the process of attendance marking swift, accurate, and resistant to errors or malpractices.
